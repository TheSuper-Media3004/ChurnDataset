# ChurnDatasetClassifier

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project that classifies customer churn using two different classification algorithms:
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Logistic Regression**

The dataset used for training and evaluation is a customer churn dataset.

## Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, feature scaling, etc.)
- Model training using Decision Tree and Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Comparison of model performance
- The comparison using confusion matrix

## Installation
To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheSuper-Media3004/ChurnDataset.git
   cd ChurnDataset
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirement.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Ensure you have the dataset (`Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`) in the appropriate directory.


## Results
The results of the classification models will be displayed in the console and visualized using matplotlib 

## Dependencies
This project requires the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

To install them, use:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib 
```
